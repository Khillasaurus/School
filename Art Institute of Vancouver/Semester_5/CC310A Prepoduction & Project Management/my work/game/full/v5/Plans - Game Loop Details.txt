EXPLANATION
===========
When a room is created, in it's "creation code" it calls the script with the same name as the room name
The room initialization script instantiates all managers, and passes in whatever parameters neccessary
	This is the closest to a constructor arguments in c++, as the variables for the managers are set
	immediately after creation
	A check needs to be done in the manager step scripts however,
	to ensure that they do not start until the values they use are different from the default
	variable's data in each manager's creation script
