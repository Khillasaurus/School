The goal of my bmp utility is to be able to generate a height map based on user settings.
An example of how this can be used to create traversable terrain:
	1) User creates a heightmap that has no two tiles more than a certain height difference, thus allowing for a smooth transition from tile to tile, call this pathway.bmp for example
	2) The user can then upload the previously made heightmap (pathway.bmp), and use that as a tile in the new heightmap. This allows for mountains/cliffs to be created with traversable walkways beside or on the mountains/cliffs

The utility is not done, and is no where near clean code, but it's a work in progress, that I plan to use for my Unity class's project.

The weird math that is done in the code is explained on my pieces of paper at home, so I'll add comments explaining later as I have to hand the homework in now.
