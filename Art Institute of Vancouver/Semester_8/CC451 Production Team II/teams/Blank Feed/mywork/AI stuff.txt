true = if(LineTraceForObjects = Hit Actor){if(Actor Tag = "AISight")}



Minimum radius to guard
---------
In the AI02Guard_BT [Behavior Tree],

if(DistanceToGT >= 2000)
{
	move to GuardTarget
	Reset Heard
}
Why is this greater than 2000? Is this the minimum radius in which the guard must be to be considered guarding a specific point?


Initial GuardTarget lacking
---------
In the AI02Guard_BT [Behavior Tree],
the guard does not have an initial GT (GuardTarget) until the player starts moving around.
The guard should be doing his own personal duties without the player having to trigger anything.


LOS boolean logic failure
---------
In the AI02Guard_Character [Blueprint Class] > EventGraph section,
once the guard has seen the player, the guard performs a LineTrace to check if LOS (Line of Sight) exists with ANY actor.
If yes (which it should be for at least the first loop), a check is performed to see if the actor hit has the tag "AIsight".
If yes, normal logic should continue, but this was not working earlier, as in spite of this if statement returning true, logic afterwords would not work.
The temporary workaround was to put the logic under the false return, in which the logic was operational.


AI Ignoring Audible Cues
---------
During runtime,
once the guard has heard the player - as seen by a print call to the screen - the guard has the correct new target goal (player's coordinates), but continues to run towards the next planned guard target.
I suspect that this issue may be solved when correcting the LineTrace issue, but I do not know this for sure.
