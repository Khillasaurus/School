Terrain Generator
=---------------=

End Goal:
 Have a user interface to control the creation of terrain which shows all changes in real time

First Step:
 Create a bmp file that is generated from random values from 0 to 255 (greyscale) using my fill alogorithm

Second Step:
 Create 3 bmp files (red, green, blue) that correspond to height in different scales (100m, 10m, m, for example)
 and combine them by reading the 3 individual bmps and outputting a single 256^3 (16,777,216) colour bmp file

Third Step://this may not make sense anymore after changing steps 1 and 2 to the way they are now
 Create a bmp file which creates terrain which is generated based off of initial conditions such as:
  - average height
  - maximum height
  - minimum height
  - maximum height differencial between two squares orthogonally
