Assignment 7 - Barbecuing - Daniel Schenker
===========================================

General Plans: Due 4:30am
{//Started at 4:17am
	You've gone camping, and you've been designated chef.
	You have to bring food back to your friends in the tents.
	The problem is, however, that the campfire and ingredients are kept away from the tents to prevent wildlife from coming too close to the sleeping area (tents).
	Your goal is to bring back food as quickly as possible to your friends,
	with points awarded based on how perfectly cooked the food is (based on time),
	as well as how long your friends have to wait for food.
	You can carry 1 to 4 dishes, but the more dishes you carry, the greater the range of the food smell will travel, thus attracting more dangerous wildlife,
	but if you do not carry enough dishes, your friends will become upset as they are very hungry.
	Also you must keep in mind, that you do not want to burn food, or else it will be wasted, and that dish will need to be restarted.
	You can only cook 4 dishes at a time.
	Every time you start a new dish, points are deducted, but usually the points gained from succesfully cooking and delivering a dish are far greater.
	The level ends (called surviving the night) when all of your friends are fed, or if you get killed by a wild animal.

Story

You've gone camping, and you've been designated chef.
You have to bring food back to your friends in
the tents, but the campfire is far away from the
tents to keepwildlife away while everyone is sleeping!
Quickly bring food back to your friends,
but don't undercook or burn anything!
The more food you carry, the faster you'll feed your
friends, but you'll attract more dangerous animals!
You survive the night once you've fed everyone.
