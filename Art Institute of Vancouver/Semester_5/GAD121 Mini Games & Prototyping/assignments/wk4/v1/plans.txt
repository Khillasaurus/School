control
--------
Check direction: left up right down
check state: onGround
If onGround, player can use directional controls
Else check if players' vertical velocity
If the player is falling, allow them to only control horizontal movement
And when the distance between the player and the ground is less than the movement speed, use move_contact_solid()
to get the players' feet to touch the ground
Else if the players' is either moving up or is stationary in the y axis, check the jump counter
If the jump counter is < 2, the player can jump once more if desired
Else the player is falling
