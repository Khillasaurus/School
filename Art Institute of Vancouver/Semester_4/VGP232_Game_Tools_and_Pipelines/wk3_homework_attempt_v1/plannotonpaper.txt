Create a bmp heightmap
	import txt file
	random
		settings

also add a function that saves the bmp as a txt file, as fwrite is simply writing from numbers anyways

CreateSmartBMP() both versions need to be completed
Convert a text file needs to be completed!

User the timer we made last semester in class to display time it took to create the bmp file

07:30 is the absolute latest I can go to bed
