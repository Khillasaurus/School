Summary
	One term-long game project using the SGE library
	Game must not have any fatal bugs (NO crashes, hangs, sudden exits)
	The project is graded on the code quality ONLY.  
	The fun factor of the game is only for the student's own practice and amusment.



Part I		-	due wk2

creative brief.  (aka CB)
	a short document describing what it is you will be making. 
	how it works. 
	why it should be made at all.
	the scope. eg: dungeon crawl.. will include 10 levels.
	the design's goals

technical design doc. (aka TD)
	a larger doc describing HOW, by way of what tools, tech, methods, you will acheive the design goals.
	it should break down the user experience into the required systems.
	the high level details of each system should be described thereby implying you know how to build them
	and technical risks should be identified. BE HONEST. 
		(work with Ken to insure the risks dont prevent your project from being complete)

proof of tech concepts 
	

Part II		- 	due wk7
	a demonstratable prototype to show to the group
	no fatal bugs
	limited functionality is obviously expected.
	unfinished features should be inaccessible (to avoid fatal bugs)

Part III	- 	due wk 9
	alpha
	normal definition: no new features - aka feature complete. 
	only bug fixing would occur hereafter

	//kgk: code to be handed in for Ken to review and grade
	// please accompany project with updated CB/TD noting scope reduction, tech changes/directions taken


Part IV		-	due wk 11
	final game presentation to group
	includes a tech design walk through of how it was made 
		- what systems did you require/design
		- what tech problems momentarily stumped you and how you overcame them
		- what you would do differently if given more time
		- how you would change the 'product' if it were to be released

		** the above tech design walk through should be written down and handed in.

	//kgk: completness of the project in terms of it being demoed, is part of the project's grade.
	// (ie: doesn't crash. all intended to be demoed features work as designed/expected)
